# Coding Challenges with Pytest

Welcome to my coding challenges repository. This project is a collection of coding problems and solutions where I emphasize the practice of unit testing using pytest.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this repository is to enhance my coding skills through hands-on experience and start to develop an understanding of test-driven development for cleaner, more robust code. 

## Directory Structure
- `/src`: Contains the source code for the coding challenges.
- `/tests`: Houses the unit tests for the corresponding source code.
