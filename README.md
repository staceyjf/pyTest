# Coding Challenges with Jest and Pytest

Welcome to my coding challenges repository. This project is a collection of coding problems and solutions with a focus on using unit testing via Jest and pytest.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this repository is to enhance my coding skills through hands-on experience and start to develop an understanding of test-driven development for cleaner, more robust code. 

## Directory Structure
Seperate folders for JavaScript & Python
- `/`: Contains the source code for the coding challenges.
- `/tests`: Houses the unit tests for the corresponding source code.
